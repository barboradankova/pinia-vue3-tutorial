Pinia
- the intuitive store for Vue.js
- is state management solution for Vue.js
- allows us to store global state in 'stores'
- modular by design - more organized
- typescript support

Global store
- every component has access to states in global store
- states can be updated by use of actions (functions inside of store)

How to Oraganize Stores
- group related data into their own stores by logical concern
- can be organized by features within our app
- do not assume a store should be created around one API/library
- can be shared state actions and getters via nested stores - there can be nested store (usage of another store)
